RBD:
Iterate through all rbd's and get snapshots
 - take snapshot if latest snapshot is older than X hours
 - remove snapshots older than X days

CephFS:
- rsync to rbd including post fsfreeze and snapshot
- remove snapshots older than X days

TODO:
- Ensure snapshot delete for backup rbd doesn't remove snapshots if there are less than X - if backup fails we don't want to end up with zero snapshots
- Make the /healthz endpoint expose something useful
- Expose metric on number of images that don't have a snapshot new enough?
- Expose metric for number of protected snapshots
- Expose metric for size of last cephfs rsync
- Handle the ceph pool properly - at the moment we assume it's always rbd
- Better handling if the cephfs_backup rbd does not exist
