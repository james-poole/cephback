RBD:
Iterate through all rbd's and get snapshots
 - take snapshot if latest snapshot is older than X hours
 - remove snapshots older than X days

CephFS:
- rsync to rbd including post fsfreeze and snapshot
- remove snapshots older than X days

TODO:
- Make the /healthz endpoint expose something useful
  - another ticker that checks that each rbd has a snapshot within interval and that rsync success is within rsync interval
- Expose metric on number of images that don't have a snapshot new enough?
- Expose metric for number of protected snapshots
- Expose metric for size of last cephfs rsync - needs to parse rsync log file...tricky
- Handle the ceph pool properly - at the moment we assume it's always rbd
- Better handling if the cephfs_backup rbd does not exist
Y - Expose metric for last success file of cephfs rsync - 0 = running
Y - Expose metric for cephfs rbd space free
Y - Ensure snapshot delete for backup rbd doesn't remove snapshots if there are less than X - if backup fails we don't want to end up with zero snapshots
Y - add inotify/watch on config file - will not work for the tickers without some rework though
- Fix health check on snapshot age - reports no snapshot within time period on a newly created pv
